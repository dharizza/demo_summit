This module provides user login redirect by roles.

*   Introduction:
Some times your clients have wonderful ideas and one of this ideas is redirect the users to different pages depending on the roles that they have, in that case "User Login Redirect" is your simple and fast solution: when the users log in the site, we redirect them to one or another page depending on their roles and the weight/priority of those roles.

*   Installation:
Install this module as you would normally install a contributed drupal module.
See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further information.

*   Configuration:
 -   Go to admin/configure/user-login-redirect, there you can find the configuration form for this module.
 -   You will find a field for the weight and a field for the redirect path for each role that you have in your system, you can fill it depending on your needs and if you don't want to specify a redirect path to some role, then don't worry, we set <front> as default value.
 -   Save your changes and have fun!
